# React Glossary

`<Glossary />` is a React component designed to mount a complete glossary
application with inputs generated by `@glossary/build`.

Distinct from `@glossary/build`, which contains uncompiled source code,
`@glossary/react` offers a precompiled Node module in order to significantly
speed up the development process.
